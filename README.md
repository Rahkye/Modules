# Modules
Allows you to quickly spoil modules


This add-on is designed to help you quickly develop, add and disable unnecessary files. 
To add a file you need to create a folder in the modules folder for example "name". 
In this folder "name" you need to create two files cl_init.lua and init.lua then use include. 
Provided you have only two files, one is responsible for the client, the other is responsible for the server side, then the include is not needed.
